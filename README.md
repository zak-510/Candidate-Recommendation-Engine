# Resume Matcher

Streamline your recruitment process with an AI-powered tool that matches candidates to job requirements. Instead of manually reviewing resumes, this application analyzes and ranks candidates based on how well their qualifications align with your job description.

## What It Does

This application serves as a recruitment assistant that automates the initial candidate screening process. You provide a job description and upload candidate resumes, and the system ranks candidates based on semantic similarity rather than simple keyword matching. The AI understands the context and meaning behind the text, providing more accurate matches.

Key capabilities include:
- **Rankings**: Candidates automatically sorted by relevance to job requirements
- **Similarity Scoring**: Each candidate receives a percentage match score for easy comparison
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Personalized explanations of why each candidate is a strong fit
- **Streamlined Interface**: Clean, web-based application

## Core Features

**Semantic Matching**: Natural language processing that goes beyond keyword matching to understand skills and experience alignment

**Similarity Scoring**: Match percentages using cosine similarity helps prioritize which candidates to review first

**AI-Powered Summaries**: Automated 2-3 sentence explanations highlighting each candidate's strengths relative to the role

**Batch Processing**: Upload and process multiple resumes simultaneously for efficient screening

**Name Detection**: Automatically extracts candidate names from resumes for easy identification  

## Deployment

This application is designed to run on Streamlit Cloud with cloud-based AI processing.

- **PyMuPDF**: Extracts text content from PDF documents
- **Scikit-learn**: Performs cosine similarity calculations for ranking

## Limitations and Notes

- **Language Support**: Optimized for English-language content; performance with other languages may vary
- **System Requirements**: Large resume batches require sufficient system memory for processing
- **AI Processing**: The AI model ensures data privacy while providing intelligent candidate assessments
- **Error Handling**: Corrupted or unreadable files are automatically skipped with appropriate warnings displayed
